// HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. 
// Responses are grouped in five classes:

// 1.Informational responses (100 – 199)
// 2.Successful responses (200 – 299)
// 3.Redirection messages (300 – 399)
// 4.Client error responses (400 – 499)
// 5.Server error responses (500 – 599)

// Successful responses
// 200 OK
// The request succeeded. 

// Client error responses 
// 400 Bad Request
// 401 Unauthorized
// 404 Not Found

// Server error responses
// 500 Internal Server Error
// The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.
// 501 Not Implemented
// The request method is not supported by the server and cannot be handled. The only methods that servers are required to support (and therefore that must not return this code) are GET and HEAD.
// 502 Bad Gateway
