// Node js is a runtime environment for java 
console.log("Hello World");

// To run :
// node index.js
// or node index ( it will also work because nodes js can only run js files so it will understand it is the JS File)

// console.log(windows);
// alert("Hey");
// The above two commnands will not work here 
// Chrome V8 Engine is not directly embeded with . All the Window and DOM type methods has been removed
// All UI Part has been reomved as the UI part is not used here we only do the server side work here 

// NPM : Node Package Manager
// package.json file is a configuration file

// after adding  "start":"node index.js" this inside the package.json file of your code 
// now you can run this by index.js by writing "npm start"
